"""Example community lesson pack (ACAD-10).

Shows the `lessons` capability: a pack is one track of declarative lessons
(markdown concept, key terms, a multiple-choice exercise) validated at
registration and rendered through the same vetted components as built-in
content. Copy this file, change the pack id, and write your lessons.
